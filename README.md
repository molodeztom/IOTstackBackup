# IOTstack Backup and Restore

This is a fork from IOTstackBackup from Paraphraser. He did the main work and I am thankful for his work. 
I have added a way to safe backups on dropbox and to keep a certain number of backups on the raspberry.
I use a Raspi4 with an USB SSD so I have plenty of local space. 
I am not an expert with linux nor bash programming. Some lines and ideas are from other sources like dropbox Uploader.
